# PetFinder_FinalProject

PetFinder was a group project for a data science class I took last semester.  I decided to extract the parts of the project I wrote to have an example of my skills using R. 

We were inspired my the Kaggle competition that wanted people to predict the adpotion outcomes of pet. Instead of following the competiton, we decided to look at the data and see if there was any recommendations for changes we would make to animal shelters to help increase adptions.  

First, I took data from wikipeadia on the Malaysian economy to help evaluate animal fees using a logistic model. My other task was to analyse pet names, and see if any animals could benefit from having thier name changed. 

Techniques Used:
* Data Scaping 
* Visulation 
* Data Wrangling 
* Machine Learning 
* Regular Expressions
